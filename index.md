**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

The most interesting thing we covered so faris geospatial data. This type of data is new to me so it has been interesting experimenting with geopandas and learning about wildfire boundary data in .shp files.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

I want to go further in wildfire burn data and create a machine learning model to if fires will occur, and if so, the intensity of the fire in a given area. 

**What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

We are currently focusing on just the burn data and while that is very important, it could be interesting to take into account other factors that affect wildfires such as other environmental conditions that could help our model be stronger. This could include thigns like how much oxygen present or a fuel source, as these factors will have an effect of ina  wildfire would occur.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

I think it would be interesting to work with data that involves datellite imagery and vegetation because that would help us consider more factors that explain the wildfire risk. This would give us information about fuel and weather conditions. If we are able to build out the model fully, we could potentially simulate different fire scenarios that could take place.
